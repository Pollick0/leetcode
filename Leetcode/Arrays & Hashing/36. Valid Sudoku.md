**Initial Approach:** 
This problem is a medium difficulty and with that in mind I know the process requires a couple more steps than previous "easy" problems (neetcode hint).

First: I began with figuring out what data structure to use that would best suit for checking duplicates. The best choice would be a hash set (neetcode hint).

Second: Now that I know I can use a hash set to store each row and column how can I efficiently check for the squares? we can use `(row / 3) * 3 + (col / 3)` to check the index of each square (neetcode hint).

Third: We can use a separate hash map for row, column, and square.

**Attempt 1:**

```python

```

**Complexity**: O(n)
