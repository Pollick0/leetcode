Difficulty: Medium

**Initial Approach:**
Use a hash map to record similar anagrams and their count

```python
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
dic = {"aet": 3, "ant": 2, "abt": 1}
```

This approach wasn't efficient at all as I would also have to save the index of each word so I ended up scrapping it.

**Second Approach**
My next approach was to check if the sorted string is in the dict then put it on the sorted list.

```python
dic = {"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan", "nat"], "abt": ["bat"]}
```

this allows me to loop through each key and append their value to a list which I could then return to complete the question

**Code**
```python
sorted_strs = []

d = {}

for s in strs:

	sorted_strs.append("".join(sorted(s)))

for s in range(0,len(strs)):

	if sorted_strs[s] not in d:

		d[sorted_strs[s]] = [strs[s]]

	else:

		 d[sorted_strs[s]].append(strs[s])

t = []

for i in d:

	t.append(d[i])

return t
```

**Complexity**: O(n * m log m)

**Final Thoughts**: It was a fun challenge
