**Initial Approach:** 
Loop through the list and increment by 1 each time and adding the value to a hash map.
Then I use max() to find the largest value in the hash map and return it.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums):
	
	hash_map = {}
	
	for n in range(0,len(nums)):
	
		if nums[n] not in hash_map:
		
			hash_map[nums[n]] = 1
		
		else:
		
			hash_map[nums[n]] += 1
	
	return max(hash_map, key=hash_map.get)
```

**Complexity**: O(n)

**Final Thoughts**: 
There are faster methods such as O(n) but I don't have the skills to do that yet, but the question itself was fairly easy and straightforward.
